### Weekly assignments
Each week I will upload my answers to the given assignments here under the following names:
- W1: _word\_counts.ipynb_  
- W2: _collocation.py_  

__Updating repo__  
To run the scripts, I recommend cloning this repository and installing relevant dependencies in a virtual ennvironment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frillecode/CDS-spring-2021-language.git
cd CDS-spring-2021-language
bash ./create_frille-lang_venv.sh
```
From then on, every time you use it, make sure to update the repository and install any new dependencies:
```bash
cd CDS-spring-2021-language
git pull origin main
bash ./create_frille-lang_venv.sh
```
__Running scripts__  
After updating the repo (see above), you can run the .py-files from the command-line by writing the following:
``` bash
$ cd CDS-spring-2021-language
$ python3 src/{filename].py
```
